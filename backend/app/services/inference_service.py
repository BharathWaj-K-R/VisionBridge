"""
Inference service: loads the frozen base model once (module-level singleton),
optionally applies a signer's BridgeAdapter, and returns decoded text +
confidence + latency — the numbers the ablation study and demo both need.

NOTE: keypoint extraction (e.g. MediaPipe Holistic on raw video/webcam
frames) is NOT implemented here. This service expects pre-extracted pose
and face keypoint tensors. Wire up the extraction step in a separate
preprocessing module once you've picked a keypoint extractor.
